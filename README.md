# Taproot Blocks

Taproot Blocks adds the reusable blocks page to the admin menu and creates a shortcode for adding reusable blocks outside the content area.

## Description
Upon activation, a new menu item named "Blocks" will show in the admin menu. This shows the "reusable blocks" interface. Each reusable block can be inserted in content, templates or widget areas using a shortcode. The shortcode for each block will be displayed within the blocks admin page.

The shortcode uses the following format:

`[block-template id="1876"]`

The shortcode accepts the "id" parameter, which should be passed the post id for the block of wp_block post type.

Note: block styles for the theme need to support blocks not in the main content area.

## Installation
1. In your admin panel, go to Appearance -> Plugins and click the 'Add New' button.
2. Upload zipped file.
3. Activate.
